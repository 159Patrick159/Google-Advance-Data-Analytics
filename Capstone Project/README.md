# Predicting Employee Turnover Rates

### Overview
The goal of this project was to create a predictive model either through multiple logistic regression or through machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifers or Categorical Gradient Boosting estimators. This project utilized employee statistics recorded by Salifort Motors and is the capstone project for Google's Advance Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The champion model for this analysis was a random forest with tuned hyper-parameters. The following metrics were used to evaluate the algorithm's success.

|Model Name|F1 Score|Precision|Recall|Accuracy|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Tuned Random Forest| 97.21%| 98.47%| 95.98%| 98.65%|

The random forest model determined the most relevant features for separating employees that are likely to leave to those who won't are `satisfaction_level`, `time_spent_with_company`, and `hours_per_project`. We note that the latter features was engineered and that it represents the employees engagement to the company's goals.

### Business Understanding
We clearly see that salary is not a leading factor for employee turnover rates, instead we see that employee activty, tenure and satisfaction are good indicators of longevity. Another important aspect of this project was to determine the best way to invest in employee training and resources without losing skilled workers. After conducting forms of hypothesis testing, we noticed that the Tech. Department has higher likelihoods to have employees who won't leave the company. So if we were to recommend a department for investing in training that would be this department.

### Data Understanding
The Salifort Motors data was synthetically generated by Google for the purpose of this project. The data consisted of approximately 12k unique employees and 9 features per employee. The features included information on employee satisfaction, evaluation, salary, company history, department, and contributed projects. The bar chart below shows the proportion of employee leaving Salifort Motors

### Modeling and Evaluation
I implemented two machine learning algorithms and matched them against each other to compare their performance based on the previous four metrics (F1 Score, Precision, Recall, Accuracy). The dataset was split into training, validating and testing sets with a (60/20/20) proportion respectively. We performed this splitting such that we are able to cross-validate our models in the process of hyper-parameter tunning; this techinque will avoid our models to overfit the training data and will improve how the model manages randomness. The results of each model are summarized in their respective confusion matrix.

From the figure above we clearly see that the random forest is the superior model, this statement is also supported by the four sucess metrics.

The random forest classifier defines feature importance on the princeple of how well that feature minimizes the impurity of a decision node. So in this context these features can be interpreted as good indicators for employee retainment. Therea are three features which are predominantely important, these will be called primary features, the reamining will be called secondary features. They can be visualized in the barplot below.
