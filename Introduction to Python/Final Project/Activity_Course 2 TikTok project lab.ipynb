    "**Question:** What do you notice about the number of views, likes, and shares for banned authors compared to active authors?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The results of using .agg on the dataframe show that there is significant difference between the mean and median of 'views' 'likes' and 'shares'. For almost all categories of 'authors_status' with the exception of the 'banned' authors in the 'views' category. Other than that section we can safely assume that the overall distribution of these sections are highly skewd. From experience when dealing with a skewd distribution it is more reliable to use the median instead of the mean as this quantity does no fluctuate as much due to the presence of outliers.\n",
